## Prompts used for the combination of Few shot and Chain-of-Thought technique

I am currently conducting research on Detecting and Resolving Ambiguities in User Stories with the help of LLMs. Can you help me answer a series of questions for my research? Following are examples to help you understand the nature of the questions:

### Example 1 
**Question 1.1:** User Story: “As an admin of the system, I want to add or delete recycling center information in the system database, so that I can keep the database up-to-date over time.” Is the provided user story ambiguous?

**Answer:** Yes, the user story is ambiguous as it mentions two features ‘add’ and ‘delete’ in a single user story.

**Question 1.2:** If your answer to the previous question is "yes", can you resolve the ambiguity and re-write the user story following the QUS framework criteria and the user story template "As a (..), I want (..), so that (..)"?

**Answer:** Yes, I can resolve the ambiguity. The correct version is: “As an admin, I want to add recycling center information to the system database so that I can keep the database up-to-date over time.”

### Example 2 
**Question 2.1:** User Story: “As a user of the system, I want to leave feedback, so that the system can be improved accordingly.” Is the provided user story ambiguous?

**Answer:** No, the user story is not ambiguous because it fulfills all the criteria of the above-mentioned QUS framework.

**Question 2.2:** If your answer to the previous question is "yes", can you resolve the ambiguity and re-write the user story following the QUS framework criteria and the user story template "As a (..), I want (..), so that (..)"?

**Answer:** There is no ambiguity hence the user story does not need to be re-written.
